# Zephyr IO-Link Master Module

This repository integrates a [forked](https://github.com/vChavezB/i-link/tree/zephyr) IO-Link Master stack from RT Labs that enables its integration with Zephyr.

## Supported PHYS

The RT-Labs stack only supports the MAX14189 PHY. This requires only from the Zephyr board side an SPI interface and an IRQ pin.

## Current Status

This repository is under development and will not provide a stable API until the first release version.
